## Overview
This project provides a collection of integrated image processing functions implemented using MATLAB GUI (Graphical User Interface). It offers a user-friendly interface for performing various image processing operations conveniently.

## Features
- User-friendly GUI for interacting with image processing functions.
- Integration of multiple image processing algorithms.
- Easy-to-use interface for loading, processing, and saving images.
- Real-time preview of image processing effects.
- Customizable parameters for adjusting processing algorithms.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (version X.X or higher)
- Image Processing Toolbox (if using certain functions)

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `main.m` file to launch the MATLAB GUI.

## Usage
1. Launch the MATLAB GUI by running the `main.m` file.
2. Load an image using the provided options.
3. Choose from the available image processing functions from the GUI menu.
4. Adjust parameters if necessary.
5. Preview the processing effect in real-time.
6. Apply the selected processing function to the loaded image.
7. Save the processed image if desired.

## Available Functions
- Image Enhancement: Brightness, Contrast, Sharpness, etc.
- Filtering: Median, Gaussian, Sobel, etc.
- Edge Detection: Canny, Prewitt, Roberts, etc.
- Morphological Operations: Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing, etc.
